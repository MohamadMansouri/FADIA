Prover
--------

1) Initialize:
	a) Initialization
	- get a key ring
	- derive a key from the keyring
	
	b) Joining
	- Send join request to the collector ( send battery level )
	- Receive Join response ( set p and v and n  ) 
	- Send back an ack
	
2) handleMessage:
	a) NeighborDiscover (active)
	- send request as broadcast to all provers ( UID, keyids)
	- receive response ( UID, keyid), add to table
	- send ack 
	
	b) NeighborDiscover (passive)
	- receive a request from a prover (UID, keyids) check if keyids match 
	- send responds (UID, keyid)
	- receive ack, add to the table
	
	c) Prove (set timer and counter)
	- send pull req as broadcast to each neighbot (UID, r1)
	- receive p1 challenges ( UID, c, r2)
	- solve challenge and respond
	- receive ack, increment counter
	
	d) verify ( set timer and counter) 
	- recive pull request ( UID, r1)
	- send challenge (UID,c, r2)
	- receive challenge solution, and validate add to ListUID, increment counter
	- send ack  
	- if counter == v or timeout, send update (UID, ListUID, fcounter)

	e) revocation:
	- receive revocation message from controller ({keyid}) 	
	- remove these keys from the keyring
