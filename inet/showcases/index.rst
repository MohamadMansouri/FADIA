Showcases
=========

INET Showcases are small simulation studies that show off various components
and features of the INET Framework. Each showcase consist of a fully
configured simulation model and a web page that presents the goal of the study,
the simulation setup and the results. Although not expressly designed as tutorials,
showcases were created in the hope that they will be directly useful for
INET users doing related simulations.

You can browse the showcase pages on this web site. The source code of
the simulations (NED, ini and other files) and the web pages are in the
`showcases/` subdirectory of the
`INET repository <https://github.com/inet-framework/inet/tree/master/showcases>`_.

.. The following showcases are available:
